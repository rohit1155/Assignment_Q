    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "ANS.Self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in Python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to refer to instance attributes."
